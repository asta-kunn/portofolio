## Backstory Why Me Made This Project?

In summary, Hameed (2010) outlines the challenges of managing the Hajj, categorizing them into issues related to management, organization, and guidance. These challenges include confusion caused by misleading locations, the inefficacy of static signage, communication barriers between international pilgrims and Hajj staff due to language differences, and a notable underutilization of advanced information and communication technologies (ICT) to address these issues.

Addressing the challenges of managing crowd density, navigation, and safety at large events like the Hajj pilgrimage, we introduce PeacePath, a state-of-the-art app. PeacePath leverages real-time crowd data to generate heatmaps and offers AR-guided navigation, enhancing the pilgrimage experience. It also issues alerts on crowded spots and security issues to both pilgrims and staff, ensuring a secure, well-informed journey for everyone involved. The pilgrims can do comparative analysis of crowd expectations against real-world numbers, distinguishing between anticipated and real-time crowd sizes.

The PeacePath Project has several features, including the following:
  - Crowd Based Route Advisor
  - Current Stream Visual
  - Density Heatmaps
  - Dynamic Crowd Analyze
  - Density Zoning Map
  - Integrated Roadway Sync
  - Notifications (Pilgrism)
  - Notifications (Staff)

## Backstory Why Me Made This Project?

Kembangin is a website designed to assist in the growth and development of children. The website offers a range of features that includes a BMI calculator, a forum where parents can ask questions to doctors, articles about child development, and recommendations for medication for children.

I have a strong background in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web development technologies. I have developed several websites with various features, such as e-commerce platforms, social networking sites, and online booking systems. I am skilled in developing websites that are responsive, mobile-friendly, and accessible, ensuring a seamless user experience across all devices.

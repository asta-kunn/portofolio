## Backstory Why Me Made This Project?

The Football App is an application developed as part of a database project. Collaborating with my teammates, we designed and developed an application that caters to the roles of
committee managers and spectators. As a team member, I successfully implemented the dashboard functionalities for Manage team manajer, dashboard manajer, dashboard panita, dashboard penonton, and for authentication (login and register)

Throughout this project, I gained valuable insights into the world of databases. I learned how to process and retrieve data efficiently using queries, triggers, stored functions, and other related techniques. This project provided an excellent opportunity for me to enhance my understanding of database management and data manipulation.
Unfortunately, the project remained incomplete due to unfinished features by one of my teammates. However, all the features that I contributed to were successfully implemented and functioned smoothly.

### Goals Build This Project

Main goals for building this project, including the following: 

- To exercise and implement `Django` after i learn this technology.
- To exercise and deeping query `Sql` 

I was learning a lot about sql database while build this project, after i finish this
project, i think my programming skills are improved over time.

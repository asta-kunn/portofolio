## Backstory Why Me Made This Project?

TBCare is a reminder and monitoring application for TB patients, developed to help pharmacists ensure their patients take their medication regularly. The app features treatment insights and notification delivery, integrated with Email and WhatsApp, so patients do not need to download an additional app to receive medication pickup reminders. Additionally, it includes features for managing medication pickup schedules, patients, and pharmacists.

### Goals Build This Project

Main goals for building this project, including the following: 

- To reminder the patients of drug pickup TBC medication
- To help apoteker in reminder automation 

I was learning a lot about Django Rest Framework and next JS while build this project, after i finish this
project, i think my programming skills are improved over time.

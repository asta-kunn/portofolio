## Backstory Why Me Made This Project?

Kokospace is an application developed as part of an advanced programming project. Collaborating with my teammates, we designed and developed an application that encompasses features such as renting rooms for accommodation, coworking spaces, meeting rooms, and a wallet top-up functionality. My specific contribution to the
project involved creating the full-stack and back-end for the Meeting Room feature

.
From the customer's perspective, users can easily reserve meeting rooms that have been created by the administrators. They can also register attendees for the scheduled meetings, along with their attendance status. Furthermore, customers have the ability to update their attendance status after booking a meeting room.On the administrator's side, they have full control over the meeting rooms. They can create, update, and delete meeting rooms as per their requirements.

Throughout this project, I gained valuable insights and experience, particularly with the challenges of implementing the back-end using Java. This provided an opportunity for me to learn about design patterns and extensively test my own code. On the full-stack side, I felt more comfortable as I was already familiar with the Next.js framework. With the application we developed, our goal is to provide convenience to both kost (accommodation) administrators and users in finding coworking spaces, meeting rooms, and available accommodation options. We hope that our application will prove to be a useful tool for kost administrators and users, streamlining the process of locating and reserving suitable coworking spaces, meeting rooms, and accommodation options.

### Goals Build This Project

Main goals for building this project, including the following: 

- To exercise and implement `NextJS` after i learn this technology.
- To exercise and implement `Springboot` after i learn this technology.

I was learning a lot about fullstack web development while build this project, after i finish this
project, i think my programming skills are improved over time.

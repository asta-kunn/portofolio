## Backstory Why Me Made This Project?

Our idea was inspired by Spotify, which started as a music streaming service and eventually integrated social features to transform into a social media platform centered around musical interests. Similarly, we observed that movie enthusiasts interact in much the same way, and there is a gap in the software field that can be filled with a social media platform tailored for them.
### Goals Build This Project

Main goals for building this project, including the following: 

1. Movie Recommendation: Utilizing content-based and collaborative filtering with TF-IDF and RAKE, our platform provides highly relevant and engaging movie recommendations tailored to user preferences. 
2. AI-Generated Movie Lists: Users can create personalized and collaborative movie lists, enhanced by AI-generated suggestions that blend user preferences. 
3. Social Engagement: Cinematch fosters a sense of community by allowing users to follow others, share personal reviews, and participate in collaborative movie list creation. 
4. Collaborative Playlists: Users can collaborate with friends to create shared movie playlists, enhancing the social experience of movie discovery.

I was learning a lot about Machine Learning, Django Rest Framework and Kotlin while build this project, after i finish this
project, i think my programming skills are improved over time.
